What Are LLMs?
LLMs (Large Language Models) are AI models trained on vast amounts of text data.
They can perform tasks like summarization, translation, and question answering.

Why 'Large'?
'Large' refers to:
Massive training datasets (often petabytes in size).
Billions or trillions of model parameters.

Pre-training vs. Fine-tuning :
Pre-training: Training on general language data.
Fine-tuning: Adjusting the model for specific tasks using smaller datasets.

Transformer Architecture :
LLMs use the Transformer model, which includes:
Self-attention mechanisms.
Positional encoding.

Prompt Design :
Crafting clear and concise prompts is crucial for effective LLM performance.
Prompt engineering can enhance results for specific tasks.

Types of LLMs :
Generic models: Predict next words based on input.
Instruction-tuned models: Follow specific instructions.
Dialogue-tuned models: Engage in conversational exchanges.


Applications :
LLMs are used in various fields, including:
Customer support.
Healthcare.
Finance.
Creative content generation.

Limitations :
High computational resource requirements.
Potential challenges in ensuring accuracy and reliability.
